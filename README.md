# Space-X-Launch-Analysis-IBM-Capstone

For this project I was employed by Space X's biggest competitor, Space Y, to analyze launch data for Space X Falcon 9 launches.

My goal was to investigate other variables to see if they influenced if a launch would be succesful or unsuccesful.

As part of my analysis I was expected to:

1. Use BeautifulSoup webscraping techniques to grab Falcon 9 launch data from the web
2. Perform data wrangling on acquired data and use one hot encoding to classify successful and unsuccesful launches numerically
3. Explore data using SQL commands
4. Visualize data by creating Seaborn plots
5. Visualize data on a US map by creating Folium plots
6. Utilize Machine Learning algorithms to see which would be most effective at predicting if a launch would be succesful
7. All files in this directory are associated with this project.
